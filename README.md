# stock-analysis

## Project Overview
In this project, we built a [data analysis tool](blob/main/VBA_Challenge.xlsm) to quickly analyze the performance of several different stocks across multiple years. The first version of the tool allowed the user to see a summary report on 12 different stocks in either the year 2017 or 2018. The analysis showed the total daily volume and the year over year return for each stock by year selected. In the second version, I refactored the code so that the report ran appoximately 5x faster.
